## Final
For your final coding challenge, you will be writing functions from a popular JavaScript utility called Lodash. Your functions will be similar but not always identical (I tried to simplify some of them).

I recommend tackling the functions in this order:

* utils/isString
* utils/isFunction
* utils/isUndefined
* utils/isArray
* arrays/concat
* arrays/filter
* arrays/reject
* arrays/chunk
* arrays/unique
* objects/keys
* objects/values
* objects/pick
* objects/omit
* objects/get
* functions/wrap
* functions/once
* functions/times
* functions/defer
* collections/for-each
* collections/map
* collections/reduce

This final is open book, open notes, and open internet. Do not copy from the internet. Many of these problems have posted solutions online. If I see code from you that we haven't talked about or is not well documented (that's right you need to comment on your code and explain what you are doing), then I may ask for further information from you to prove you know what you wrote.

Best of luck!
